# Simple Counting Sort
# In a simple sort, the only values that matter are the ones you are sorting. They are not keys to any other values. This makes counting sort very simple. If you already counted the values in the list, you don’t need to access the original list again. This challenge involves a simple counting sort where the elements being sorted are all that matter.

# Given an unsorted list of integers, output all the integers in ascending order.
# You should use your previous code that counted the items to print out the actual values in-order.

# Challenge
# Using your previous counting code, return an Array with the list of integers in order.

# Example
# p simple_counting_sort([63, 25, 73, 1, 98, 73, 56, 84, 86, 57, 16, 83, 8, 25, 81, 56, 9, 53, 98, 67, 99, 12, 83, 89, 80, 91, 39, 86, 76, 85, 74, 39, 25, 90, 59, 10, 94, 32, 44, 3, 89, 30, 27, 79, 46, 96, 27, 32, 18, 21, 92, 69, 81, 40, 40, 34, 68, 78, 24, 87, 42, 69, 23, 41, 78, 22, 6, 90, 99, 89, 50, 30, 20, 1, 43, 3, 70, 95, 33, 46, 44, 9, 69, 48, 33, 60, 65, 16, 82, 67, 61, 32, 21, 79, 75, 75, 13, 87, 70, 33])
